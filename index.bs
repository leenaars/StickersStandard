Abstract: This specification defines a standard for sticker compatibility from multiple vendors.
Abstract: By following this specification, implementors can ensure they meet the expectations of sticker consumers.
Abstract: A standard allows producers to supply tools that help ensure maximum compliance and enjoyability.

<h2 id="intro" class="no-num">Introduction</h2>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

<h2 id="type">Types of Stickers</h2>

<h3 id="type-square">Square Sticker</h3>
A <dfn>square sticker</dfn> must be represented by a square with sides that should measure 5.08 centimeters, and must remain within 1 millimeter tolerance.

<div class="note">These tolerances allow for square stickers with sides that measure between 4.98 and 5.18 centimeters.</div>

<h3 id="type-hexagon">Hexagon Sticker</h3>
A <dfn>hexagon sticker</dfn> must be represented by a regular hexagon where the largest diagonals should measure 5.08 centimeters, and which must remain within 1 millimeter tolerance.
The sticker must be oriented with a vertex positioned at the top.

<div class="note">These tolerances allow for diagonals measuring between 4.98 and 5.18 centimeters.</div>

<h2 id="relative-sizes">Relative sizes</h2>

Should an implementor seek to deliver stickers with dimensions other than the defined default sizes, these should be either submultiples or integer multiples of the default sizes. The following notation is used:

- for fractions use "nXS" as an affix, with n being a natural number higher than 1. For example "2XS" for a sticker where each of the dimensions is half (1/2 x) the size of the standard dimensions of the given type. As a result the surface area would be 1/2² = 1/4 of the surface area of the default size.
- for multiples use "nXL" as an affix, with n being a natural number higher than 1. For example "3XL" for a sticker where each of the dimensions is thrice (3 x) the size of the standard dimensions of the given type. As a result the surface area would be 3x3 = 9 times the surface area of the default size.

<div class="note">Note that artwork designed for alternative dimensions should take into consideration the physical size of the resulting sticker, in particular for smaller sizes loss of detail is to be expected. Make sure that lines, dots and other fine aspects are scaled accordingly. Tolerances for stickers with larger sizes remain at 1 millimeter tolerance, while for smaller sizes tolerances are scaled down on a best effort basis.</div>

When you exchange stickers, you may be given a sticker that does not conform to this specification.
If this is the case, thank them for the time spent on designing and printing the sticker.
